# GTFOBins Search v1.0

**Author: Djefferson Saintilus**

GTFOBins Search is a command-line tool that allows you to easily search GTFOBins ([https://gtfobins.github.io](https://gtfobins.github.io)) for privilege escalation and bypass techniques using various Unix-like binaries.

GTFOBins is a curated collection of Unix binaries that can be abused to bypass local security restrictions in misconfigured systems. It provides a list of binaries along with the potential exploitation techniques associated with them.

With GTFOBins Search, you can search GTFOBins by entering a specific term and receive a list of matching results. Each result includes the associated function name and the corresponding command for performing the exploitation technique.
